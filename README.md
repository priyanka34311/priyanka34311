### Welcome! The repositories below contain a selection of codes I have written for various projects and tasks. I learned how to code using MATLAB and Bash, but these days, I typically write code in Python. 

Other languages and packages used: SAS, SPSS, Bayesian Logic (BLOG), Microsoft Excel, and R

Note: Any queries about the code can be sent to: prr2117@caa.columbia.edu. Thanks!
