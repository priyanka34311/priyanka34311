### Welcome! The repositories below contain a selection of codes I have written for various projects and tasks. I learned how to code using MATLAB and Bash, but these days, I typically write code in Python. 

Other languages: SAS, R, and Bayesian Logic (BLOG)

Note: I comment often to stay organized and document my own logic, so the scripts should be comprehensible. That being said, I was often the sole data analyst in many of the projects below, so the scripts were written only for one person in mind (me) and not a team. Any queries about the code can be sent to: prr2117@caa.columbia.edu.
